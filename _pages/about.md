I'm a fourth year Ph.D. candidate from [X-LANCE Lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Mengyue Wu](https://myw19.github.io/) and [Prof. Kai Yu](https://x-lance.github.io/kaiyu/). My research interest includes audio / speech / music understanding and generation, and large language models.

You can find my CV [here](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).

**I am going to graduate in June, 2025 and I am open to job opportunities in 2025. Please feel free to contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xuenan-xu-10a03813a) or [Wechat](../images/wechat.jpg).**


ðŸš€ Research & Projects
======
My research mainly focuses on general **audio understanding and generation**, including tasks such as *audio captioning*, *text to audio grounding*, *audio-text retrieval* and *text to audio generation*. I am also interested in *speech / music understanding and generation*, and their interaction with general audio.

Here are some selected publications or projects:
* Audio Understanding
